# Colors
A Web3 App that mints a random color as an NFT on the Blockchain

# The Gambit
- Make an algorithm to mint NFTs and then build a web app to sell those NFTs with smart contracts and through OpenSea
- First make NFTs based on a singular color hex code or rgb value
- Also make a rarity for different rgb color codes
- Then use solidity in order for someone to generate an NFT via a smart contract
- Build a web app to sell those NFTs and then use OpenSea as well
- Profit???
